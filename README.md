**Collect atoms, build objects and sell them!**

**Split the atom or smash them together!**

**Fill in the Periodic Table and create new elements!**

**Can you make a trillion dollars using just atoms?**

What's the Matter is an semi-Educational, semi-Incremental atom collecting game, available on [Itch.io](https://joshuakey.itch.io/whats-the-matter).

What's The Matter was designed to be as scientifically accurate as possible; including real world information about atoms, such as their weight, where they can be found, what they can be used for. 
All information is avaiable within the game after the player discovers the element.

## Story
Dr. Scientist has accumulated a insane debt of $1,000,000,000,000. Luckily, he just happens to have an Atom Collector lying around. 

Can you help him fix his debt?

## Gameplay
Player's will use Dr. Scientist's Atom Collector to collect atoms from everyday objects and the environment. However, the Atom Collector isn't perfect and it'll need some upgrades. Luckily, Dr. Scientist will be able to upgrade it with atoms you collect.

Some atoms may prove themselves hard to find however. In that case, you'll need to split or combine existing atoms.

As you progress, you'll unlock new locations which will allow you to collect new atoms.

Later on, players may even be able to create never before seen atoms and help expand the periodic table.

And finally, you can use the atoms you collect to craft items which can be sold to help settle Dr. Scientist's debt.
