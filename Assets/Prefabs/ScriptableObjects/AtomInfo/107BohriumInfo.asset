  description: 'Bohrium is produced by bombarding Bismuth with Chromium, supposedly
    with the ''Cold Fusion'' method, a method where Nuclear Reactions can occur at
    room temperature or below. Normally Nuclear Reations require immense heat and
    pressure, typically from a star. It has not been proven, however, and is in fact
    looked down upon due to its large failure. However, a possible replacement method
    known as Muon-catalyzed fusion may work.

    Supposedly, the isotope Bh<sup>278</sup> may have aa halflife of 11 miutes.

    Bohrium is named after Danish Physicist, Daniels Bohr.'
