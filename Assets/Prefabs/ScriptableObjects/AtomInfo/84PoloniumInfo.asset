  description: 'Polonium is a silver grey semi-metal. It has a short halflife and
    is rare both naturally and artificially. However, its halflife also makes it a
    good source of neutron and alpha particles.

    Polonium was the first element discovered because of its radioactivity.

    Polonium is named after Poland.'
