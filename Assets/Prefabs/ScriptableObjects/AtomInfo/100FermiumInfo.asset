  description: 'Fermium has not been synthesized large enough to be visible, although
    it is possible to do so. It is the last element that can be produced from neutron
    bombardment of other elements.

    Like Einsteinium, it was discovered during the first Hydrogen Bomb.

    Fermium is named after nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi.'
