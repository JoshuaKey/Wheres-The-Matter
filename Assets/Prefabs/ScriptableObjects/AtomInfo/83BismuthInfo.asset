  description: 'Bismuth is a brittle, white metal that can refract light to make a
    rainbow. It is the start of the Radioactive elements meaning every element including
    and after Bismuth is radioactive and has no stable isotopes. Despite this, Bismuth
    has such a long halflife that it can be considered stable. It is mainly used in
    cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.

    It was one of the first 10 metals discovered but its name origin is unknown.'
