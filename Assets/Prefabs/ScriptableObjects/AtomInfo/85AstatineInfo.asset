  description: 'Astatine is the rarest naturally ocurring element and the 2nd most
    unstable element of the first 101. It is so unstable that we have not been able
    to make a pure sample of Astatine and have no idea what it looks like. If we were
    to have a pure sample, it would immediately vaporize itself from the heat of its
    own radiation. Because of this, we do not know is Astatine is a Halogen, Mettaloid,
    Non Metal or Metal. It is traditionally considered a metalloid.

    Despite not being able to produce a solid sample, Astatine has some use in the
    medical industry and its properties have been predicted from similar atoms.

    Astatine is named after ''Astatos'' meaning Unstable in Ancient Greek.'
