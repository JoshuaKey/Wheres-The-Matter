  description: 'Cobalt is a hard bluish gray metal. Its been used since ancient times
    as jewelery for its blue color, hence Cobalt Blue.

    Cobalt is essntial for life, but only a small amount. In large amounts it can
    cause cancer. In fact the Tobacco plant can absorb Cobalt which can then be inhaled
    by smoking the plant.

    Cobalt is named after the German word ''Kobald'' meaning Goblin.'
