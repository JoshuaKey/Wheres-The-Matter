  description: 'Copper is a soft, malleable, red orange metal. It is mostly used in
    electrical equipment for its high thermal and electric conductivity.

    Historically, Copper is one of the first elements discovered and used by Humanity,
    dating back to 5000 B.C.

    Copper comes from the Old English word ''Coper'' which is derived from Latin word
    ''Cyprium Ares'' meaning metal from Cyprus.'
