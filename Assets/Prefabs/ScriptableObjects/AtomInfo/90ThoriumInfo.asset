  description: "Thorium is a hard, malleable silver metal that turns black when exposed
    to air. Although it is radioactive, Isotope Th<sup>232</sup> has a halflife of
    14 billion years making it effectively stable and quite abundant, 3x more common
    than Uranium. \nIt is mainly used as a substitute for Uranium and creates a decay
    sequence called the Thorium Series which stabilizes to Lead.\nThorium is named
    after Thor, The Scandanavium God of War."
