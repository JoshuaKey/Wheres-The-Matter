  description: 'Thallium is a toxic, soft, grey metal. It has historically been used
    in rat poison, insectides and murder giving it the name ''The poisoner''s poison''
    and resulting in being banned in many countries.

    When alloyed with Mercury, it creates a substance with a melting point 20<sup>o</sup>
    C less than Mercury''s melting point.

    Thallium is derived from ''Thallos'' meaning Green Twig in Ancient Greek.'
