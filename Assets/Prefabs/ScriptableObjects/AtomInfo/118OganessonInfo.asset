  description: 'Oganess is produced from bombarding Californium and Calcium is the
    heaviest known element. Despite being in Group 18 which is filled with Noble Gases,
    it may be a solid metal at Standard Conditions due to its high atomic weight.

    It was named after Russian nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian who was alive at
    the time of naming making it 1 of 2 elements named after a living person, the
    other being Seaborgium.'
