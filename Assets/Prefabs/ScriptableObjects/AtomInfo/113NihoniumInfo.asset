  description: 'Nihonium is named after Japan, which refers to itself as Nihon, or
    Nippon, meaning Sun Origin. It may be a Post Transition Metal, but no tests have
    been conducted.

    It is produced from bombarding Bismuth with Zinc and is believed to be in the
    ''Island of Stability'', an element with a magic number of protons that reverses
    of halts some of the radioactive properties of heavy elements making them more
    stable.'
