  description: 'Selenium can appear as black beads, red powder, or grey stone depending
    on its temperature and state. It is mainly used in glass.

    Selenium is essential for some species to live. In Humans, we need an average
    of about 14 miligrams of Selenium and each cell contains over a million selenium
    atoms.

    Selenium comes from ''Selene'' meaning Moon in Ancient Greek. It was given this
    name because it was discovered shortly after Tellurium meaning ''Earth''.'
