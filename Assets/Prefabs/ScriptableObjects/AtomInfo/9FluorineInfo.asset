  description: 'Flourine is a deadly, toxic, pale yellow gas that reacts explosively
    with Alkali Metals and causes spontaneous combustions with other elements.

    It is extremely reactive, reacting with nearly every other element including Noble
    Gases and is used with Uranium for nuclear power.

    Flourine derives from ''fluere'' meaning ''Flow'' in Latin.'
