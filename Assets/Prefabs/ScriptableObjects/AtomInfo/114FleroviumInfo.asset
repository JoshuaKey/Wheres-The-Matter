  description: "Flerovium is named after the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions
    of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia.\nIt is produced
    by bombarding Plutonium with Calcium and studies have shown that it may act similar
    to Copernicium and be a gas at room temperature. In fact, it might be considered
    a Noble Gas due to its low reactivity.\nFlerovium is considered to be near the
    center of the 'Island of Stability' an element with a magic number of protons
    that reverses of halts some of the radioactive properties of heavy elements making
    them more stable. In fact, Fl<sup>298</sup> may be doubly magic having a magic
    number of protons and neutrons.\n \nAlbert Ghiorso, who helped to discover Flerovium,
    visited Glenn Seaborg to report his discovery. He recalls, \"I wanted Glenn to
    know, so I went to his bedside and told him. I thought I saw a gleam in his eye,
    but the next day when I went to visit him he didn't remember seeing me. As a scientist,
    he had died when he had that stroke.\""
