  description: "Rhodium is a hard, corrosion resistant, and inert metal. This makes
    it one of the few noble metals, or metals that don't react too often. \nIt is
    mainly used in cars as a Catalytic Convertor, or to convert toxic gas to less
    harmful substances, in Exhaust Pipes.\nRhodium is named after 'Rhodon' meaning
    Rose colored in Ancient Greek."
