  description: 'Neon is a colorless gas that appears bright red in an electrical field.

    Its name derives from ''neos'' meaning ''New'' in Ancient Greek.

    Due to being a Noble Gas, it does not react easily. Since it is also lighter than
    air, it is rare on Earth. Despite this, it is the 5th most common element in the
    Universe.
