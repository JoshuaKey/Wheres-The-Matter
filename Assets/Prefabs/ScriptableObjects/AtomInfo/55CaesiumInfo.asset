  description: 'Caesium, spelled as Cesium in American spelling, is a soft, silvery,
    gold metal that is liquid at room temperature. It is the most reactive metal and
    the least electronegative element, meaning it is unlikely to attract electrons
    towards itself.

    Caesium''s electromagnetic radiation was used to define the meter, second and
    is now used in atomic clocks.

    The name comes from ''Caesius'' meaning Sky Blue in Latin.
