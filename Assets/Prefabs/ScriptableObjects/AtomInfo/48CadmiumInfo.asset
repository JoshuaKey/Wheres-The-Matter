  description: 'Cadmium is a toxic bluish-grey metal. It was commonly used for steel,
    pigments, glass, and plastic, but is not used as much anymore because of its toxicity.
    In fact, Cadmium can cause birth defects and cancer.

    Cadmium is named after ''Cadmia'', the Latin name for Calmine.'
