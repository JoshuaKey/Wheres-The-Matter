  description: "Radon is a radioactive, colorless, odorless, tasteless gas. It is
    considered a health hazard and is responsible for most naturally occuring Radiation
    and rated the 2nd most frequent cause of Lung Cancer.\r\nDespite its short halflife
    it is part of the decay chain from Uranium to Lead meaning it has a consistent
    supply. \nRadon comes from Radium because is was discovered during radioactive
    decay of Radium. "
