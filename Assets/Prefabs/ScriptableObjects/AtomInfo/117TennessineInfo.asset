  description: 'Tennessine is produced from bombarding Berkelium and Calcium and is
    the 2nd heaviest element known. It was discovered after Oganesson and is the most
    recent element discovered.

    Althoug it falls in the Group 17 which are all Halogens, Tennessine may not be
    a Halogen because of its heavy mass. Instead, it is predicted to be a Metal.

    It is named after the US state of Tennessee.'
