  description: 'Technetium is the lightest material where all its isotopes are radioactive.
    This makes it unstable and extremely rare. In fact, Technetium does not occur
    naturally. Its halflifes are too short compared to the age of the Earth.

    It was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev before it was discovered and its existence
    puzzled scientists for a while until is was artificially made in 1937.

    Its name comes from ''Teknetos'' meaning Artificial in Ancient Greek.
