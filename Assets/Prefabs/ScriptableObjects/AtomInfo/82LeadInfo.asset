  description: 'Lead is a toxic, soft, malleable, bluish white metal that turns grey
    when it encounters air. Becuase of it''s toxicity, it has been used less and less.
    It is now used in batteries, paints, and bullets.

    Lead is the last stable element. Starting with Bismuth, all of its isotopes are
    radioactive and will eventually decay. Specifically, Pb<sup>208</sup> is the heaviest
    stable isotope.'
